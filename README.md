# Product Image Cleaner / Adobe Commerce from Admin

Deleting a product in Magento does not delete the images it stores on the server. These images will probably stay there forever clogging up your disk space.

Intarmour's extension allows you to delete these unused product images easily from your Magento admin.


### Installation Using Composer (recommended)
```
require intarmour/module-image-clean
```
